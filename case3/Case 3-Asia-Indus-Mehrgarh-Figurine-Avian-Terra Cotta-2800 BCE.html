Buff, terracotta fertility figurine, with mythical avian facial features and full hair, which hangs down her right shoulder in a long braid.  A veil or headdress crowns her head laterally with her hair is exposed at back. Her large round eyes are deeply incised suggesting an owl-like countenance, possibly indicating omniscience, and her face is characteristically bird-like, with a nose in the shape of an owl's beak. Long, elegant legs bend slightly at the hip and knees. Legs end in delicate, tiny, three "toes" suggesting a bird's claw. Her shoulders are broad and square with her arms extending downwards and forward at her waist as though offering an answer to a suppliant petitioner: we can only imagine what the ancient donor wished for. </p><p><strong>LC Classification:</strong></p><p><strong>Date or Time Horizon:</strong> Mehrgarh (Urdu: م‍ﮩ‍رگڑھ ), Period VII, 2800 – 2600 BCE</p><p><strong>Geographical Area:</strong> Mehrgarh (Urdu: م‍ﮩ‍رگڑھ ), Period VII, 2800 – 2600 BCE</p><p><strong>Map: </strong></p><p><strong>GPS coordinates:</strong></p><p><strong>Cultural Affiliation:</strong> </p><p><strong>Media:</strong> </p><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> H 122 mm</p><p><strong>Weight:  </strong></p><p><strong>Condition: </strong>She has been repaired in several places as well as her right arm and foot.</p><p><strong>Provenance:</strong> </p><p><strong>Discussion:</strong></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p>
