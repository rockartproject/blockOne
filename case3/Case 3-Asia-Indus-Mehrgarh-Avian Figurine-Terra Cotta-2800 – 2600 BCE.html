<p>Case 3-Asia-Indus-Mehrgarh-Avian Figurine-Terra Cotta-2800 – 2600 BCE</p><p>Mehrgarh (Urdu: م‍ﮩ‍رگڑھ ), Period VII, 2800 – 2600 BCE</p><p>From one of the earliest Neolithic Indus Valley sites on "Kachi plain" in Balochistan, Pakistan with evidence of farming (wheat and barley) and herding (cattle, sheep and goats). Buff, terracotta fertility figurine, with mythical avian facial features and full hair, which hangs down her right shoulder in a long braid.  A veil or headdress crowns her head laterally with her hair is exposed at back. Her large round eyes are deeply incised suggesting an owl-like countenance, possibly indicating omniscience, and her face is characteristically bird-like, with a nose in the shape of an owl's beak. Long, elegant legs bend slightly at the hip and knees. Legs end in delicate, tiny,  three "toes" suggesting a bird's claw. She has been repaired in several places as well as her right arm and foot. Her high-set, full, rounded breasts are exposed with delicately formed, raised nipples.  Her shoulders are broad and square with her arms extending downwards and forward at her waist as though offering an answer to a suppliant pettitioner: we can only imagine what the ancient donor wished for. 122 mm. high.</p>
