\expndtw-4\cgrid in Tokyo. The author states that the history of Japanese archi\-}{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid tecture took an interest in the farmhouse only recently; before, }{\expnd-1\expndtw-5\cgrid only the architecture of Shinto shrines, Buddhist buildi
ngs and }{\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid mansions of nobility were given attention. The author correctly }{\expnd0\expndtw-4\cgrid says that the history of the farmhouse is the history of the Japa\-}{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid nese people. In fact, the cultural hist
ory of the Japanese people }{\expnd0\expndtw2\cgrid is to a great extent reflected in the history of the farmhouse. }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid Thus the student of Japanese religion or of the Japanese society }{\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid or the economic life c
an find in the farmhouse important data }{crystalized. Only a few houses have been found so far that were }{\expnd-1\expndtw-5\cgrid built as early as the beginning of the Tokugawa era, in the early }{\expnd0\expndtw1\cgrid seventeenth century. They are g
iven special care as cultural }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid monuments by the Governmental agency concerned. The aver\-age life expectation of a Japanese farmhouse may be around }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid eighty years. Sooner or later farmhouses fall prey to fir
e. This is no wonder in view of the inflamable material of which they are }{\expnd0\expndtw1\cgrid built and the open fire-place in them. The building material is }{\expnd0\expndtw3\cgrid all wood, the roof is reed- or straw-thatched, part of the floor }{
\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid is covered with boards and straw-mats (tatami), and the room }{\expnd0\expndtw2\cgrid partitions are made with paper covered sliding doors. When }{\expnd0\expndtw-4\cgrid making investigation in villages, one finds that some farmho
uses have a more elaborate interior as far as the size and the number, }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid and decoration of the rooms goes. They contain many urban }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid elements, improvements taken over from the mansions of the }{noblemen and h

\expnd0\expndtw-4\cgrid types, three things have to be examined, that is the roof, the ar\-}{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid rangement of the rooms, and the construction. As to the con\-struction, the common type is }{\f22\fs24\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid that }{\expnd0
\expndtw0\cgrid with a rectangular ground-}{\expnd0\expndtw-3\cgrid plan, but in some areas the house has a ground-plan which con\-}{\expnd0\expndtw1\cgrid sists of two rectangles combined in a right angle. Such houses }{\expnd0\expndtw2\cgrid are called
 }{\f0\fs21\expnd0\expndtw2\i\cgrid magariya }{\expnd0\expndtw2\cgrid (bent houses) , or }{\f0\fs21\expnd0\expndtw2\i\cgrid kagite }{\expnd0\expndtw2\cgrid (key-houses) , be\-}{cause of their shape. In Northeast Japan down the Sea of Japan }{\expnd0
\expndtw3\cgrid to Niigata and to Aizu in Fukushima Prefecture, such houses }{\expnd0\expndtw1\cgrid are common. Houses with a simple ground-plan, consisting of only one rectangle, are called }{\f0\fs21\expnd0\expndtw1\i\cgrid sugoya }{\expnd0\expndtw1
\cgrid (straight houses). In the }{\expnd0\expndtw2\cgrid protruding shorter part of a 'bent house,' that is in the web of the key of the 'key-houses,' the horses have their stable. This }{\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid part of the house is two-storied. In the u
pper floor the fodder is }{\expnd0\expndtw2\cgrid stored. Iwate Prefecture and the Eastern part of Aomori Pre\-}{\expnd0\expndtw1\cgrid fecture were always outstanding for their horse breeding. The }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid `bent houses,' therefore, are co
mmon there. Because of heavy }{\expnd0\expndtw1\cgrid snowfall the farmers wish to have their horses inside the house }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid of men, so that no courtyard need be crossed to attend to the }{horses, at the same time the horses get a little
 warmth from the }{\expnd0\expndtw3\cgrid fire-place. About one third of the interior of a farmhouse has }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid only a plain wooden floor which is partly covered with thickly }{\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid woven straw-mats (tatami). At the wa
ll-side of the wooden floor }{\expnd0\expndtw2\cgrid (doma, literally earth-place) , the barn for the horses is built in }{a way that the horses can be seen from the living quarters. Since a great capital is invested in the horses, the farmers treat them
 }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid with tender care.

\expnd1\expndtw5\cgrid of the hook (jizaikagi) from which to hang the cauldron over }{\expnd0\expndtw1\cgrid the fire goes together with the living areas of the two different }{races. The cauldron ring is found chiefly west of Gifu Prefecture, }{\expnd0
\expndtw3\cgrid the cauldron hook east of Nagano Prefecture, in Shikoku and }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid in the mountains of Central Kyilsha, that is, in more marginal areas. The cauldron hook seems to have been in use already in }{\expnd0\expndtw2\cgrid the 
Yayoi period and later in the Tumuli period. Furthermore, }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid in the countryside there is an area with a hearth for cooking and }{\expnd0\expndtw-4\cgrid an area with a fire-place for the same purpose. In Eastern Japan }{\expnd0
\expndtw2\cgrid people rarely transport loads on their heads, but they do it in }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid Izu, Tshikawa, Niigata, and Miyagi. In Western Japan, however, }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid this customs is found everywhere. Eastern and Western Japan h
ave many distinct customs. Patriarchal clan federations have }{\expnd-1\expndtw-6\cgrid their densest distribution in Eastern Japan. Kinship associations, }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid including the maternal uncle, are frequently found in Western }{\expnd0
\expndtw-4\cgrid Japan. A change from clan federations to kinship associations is }{\expnd0\expndtw-3\cgrid hardly thinkable. In Western Japan the position of the maternal }{\expnd0\expndtw-4\cgrid uncle has always been high. All these differences between
 Eastern }{\expnd0\expndtw4\cgrid and Western Japan have their roots in a tribal difference. At }{\expnd0\expndtw-4\cgrid the end of the Heian time we find seven political parties each in }{\expnd0\expndtw1\cgrid Musashi and in Nasu. Western Japan never s
aw the formation }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid of such parties. They are federations of patriarchal clans which }{\expnd0\expndtw1\cgrid are not based on blood relationship but on the relationship of lords and vassals. It was on this basis that the Minamoto cl

g its ground, the Japanese Folklore Science }{\expnd0\expndtw-3\cgrid must reflect again and again upon how to improve its methodolo\-}{\expnd0\expndtw2\cgrid gical procedures. Its subject matter is the Japanese culture. }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid Instead o
f comparing the cultures of other peoples with that of }{\expnd0\expndtw-3\cgrid their own, the Japanese folklorists still tend to explain the Japa\-}{\expnd-1\expndtw-7\cgrid nese culture without affording themselves a look at that of peoples }{\expnd0

. }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid The Japanese folklorists will profit greatly also in their }{\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid methodological approach if they give up their self-imposed isola\-}{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid tion. With his suggestion Seki Keigo has certainly

 this }{question has never been touched. The origin, the formation, and }{\expnd-1\expndtw-6\cgrid the structure of the Japanese people were never a concern of the }{\expnd0\expndtw-3\cgrid Japanese folklorists. Questions of this kind were considered to }
{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid belong to the realm of ethnology and anthropology. The Japa\-nese folklorists took it for granted that their people were always }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid a homogeneous entity and the folk customs were only variations }{\expnd0

 the main, this had already happened when }{\expnd-1\expndtw-5\cgrid the Chinese and Buddhist culture arrived and met, as the latest }{\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid additions to it, an established pattern of culture without changing }{\expnd0\expndtw1\cgrid it 
basically. It is the task of Folklore Science to study the forms }{\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid of life of all groups and layers of the folk. These are specifically }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid clothing, food, dwelling, social structure and organizations, re\-}{
\expnd-1\expndtw-7\cgrid ligious rites and beliefs, and techniques, in other words, the whole }{\expnd0\expndtw1\cgrid traditional culture of the community. Though the higher ranks }{\expnd0\expndtw2\cgrid of the community follow many individualistic tend
encies, they }{\expnd0\expndtw-4\cgrid are by no means cut off from the culture of the community. Oka }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid sticks here to well known theoretical principles of the Western }{\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid Folklore Science. He then discusses t
he problem of how the cul\-}{\expnd-1\expndtw-5\cgrid tural history of Japan can be reconstructed. He demands that in investigations and collections of data the single item must not be }{\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid isolated but be seen in synthesis with all o
thers so that meaning }{and function of each of them can be properly understood. Oka }{\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid finds it possible that several types of villages and family systems }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid and social organisations exist in Japan. In the me
thodological procedure he proposes that first the typology, then the diffusion }{\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid and then the historical background should be studied in all fields }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid of folklife. He is convinced of the existence of at least 
two }{\expnd0\expndtw3\cgrid different types of villages. The one, he writes, is based on the }{\expnd0\expndtw2\cgrid age class system, the other one on a tribal organisation with }{patriarchal families from which new families have branched off. All thes
e families occupy a common territory. When, while ap\-}{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid plying a sociological and historical procedure in methodology, }{\expnd-1\expndtw-5\cgrid everything possible has been done in the domestic field, it is then }{\expnd0
\expndtw-2\cgrid imperative to consult ethnology for a comparison of the findings }{\expnd0\expndtw4\cgrid with those from among other peoples. In a final chapter Oka }{\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid has some good remarks to make concerning the special character
 }{\expnd0\expndtw-3\cgrid of the Japanese Folklore Science. He finds that its founder, Yana\-}{\expnd-1\expndtw-5\cgrid gita Kunio, has in the main followed Frazer who is essentially an }{\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid evolutionist. Japanese Folklore Science ca

a small handful of scholars. We }{hope that their number increases steadily and that Japanese }{\expnd-1\expndtw-6\cgrid ethnologists may perhaps engage themselves less in costly expedi\-}{\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid tions to foreign countries as long as moun

pelled to enter }{into them. Puppets were furthermore the seat of gods and spirits }{\expnd0\expndtw3\cgrid after the latter had been called down by their worshippers. In }{\expnd1\expndtw5\cgrid old literary documents, such as the }{\fs19\expnd1\expndtw5

erms }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid for puppets which refer to the material they were made of or to }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid their function in the worship of gods. The basic elements in the }{\expnd1\expndtw5\cgrid belief in puppets are: 1) puppets are a magic
 means to call }{\expnd0\expndtw1\cgrid spirits, and 2) puppets serve as means to eliminate impurity. }{\expnd-1\expndtw-8\cgrid About 50 kinds of puppets are listed in the Comprehensive Nomen\-}{\expnd0\expndtw3\cgrid clature of Japanese Folklore Terms }
{\fs19\expnd0\expndtw3\i\cgrid (Sogo Nihon }{\expnd0\expndtw3\cgrid minzoku goi). }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid The Japanese art of puppet making and the puppet show have their roots in religious grounds. The author substantiates his }{\expnd0\expndtw1\cgrid s
tatement by showing first what kind of puppets were and are }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid still used singly for religious and magic purposes. Such puppets }{\expnd0\expndtw-4\cgrid are moved around by the hands of a player, this movement being }{\expnd0
\expndtw4\cgrid called "dance of the god" (kamimai). The performance is not }{enacted for human onlookers, and no human activities are imitat\-}{\expnd0\expndtw2\cgrid ed, but the movements of the puppets are taken as those of a }{\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid 
god or spirit who wants to communicate his will to human beings. }{\expnd1\expndtw5\cgrid A simple piece of wood may serve as the seat of the god. One }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid of the names for religious puppets is }{\fs19\expnd0\expndtw-1\i\cgrid kugutsu
, }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid of which the ety\-}{\expnd0\expndtw1\cgrid mology can easily be ku }{\fs19\expnd0\expndtw1\i\cgrid (ki) -gutsu, }{\expnd0\expndtw1\cgrid that is 'piece of wood.' Pup\-}{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid pets with eyes, noses, hands and f
eet appeal not only to gods but }{\expnd0\expndtw2\cgrid to man as well. The }{\fs19\expnd0\expndtw2\i\cgrid Oshirasama, }{\expnd0\expndtw2\cgrid figures manipulated by a sort }{\expnd-1\expndtw-6\cgrid of female shamans in Northeastern Japan, are still n
ot more than }{\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid wooden sticks clad in a piece of cloth, so that many see in it the }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid most primitive form of cultic puppets. In the Middle Ages pro\-}{\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid fessional players created refined a

 founded in 1887. From }{\expnd-1\expndtw-5\cgrid 1888 the society opened branches in all districts of the province. }{Folklore research ranked always high in the endeavors of this }{\expnd0\expndtw3\cgrid group of progressive educators. Early in this cen
