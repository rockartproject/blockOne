The almost flat interior circle on the interior base of the cup, called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tondo_%28art%29">tondo</a>, was the primary surface for painted decoration in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-figure_pottery">Black-figure</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-figure_pottery">Red-figure</a> styles. As the representations would be covered with wine, the scenes would only be revealed in stages as the wine was drained. They were often designed with this in mind, with scenes created so that they would surprise or titillate the drinker as they were revealed.
