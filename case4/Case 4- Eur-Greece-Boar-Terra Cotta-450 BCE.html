<p>Case 4- Eur-Greece-Boar-Terra Cotta-450 BCE</p><p>A solid terracotta figurine of a boar in an aggressive posture with molded ears pointed snout and ridged back. There is a crack along the line where the two sides were originally joined together; a chip is missing from the back, above the hind quarters. The bottom part of the front end has been broken off and re-joined. The clay is dark buff with traces of white remain.  <br/><br/>Originally, the boar was coated in white slip, but this has now been badly eroded.</p><p>terracotta pigs were a very popular votive along with cocks, doves, tortoises and other animals. Pigs were offered in sacrifice to Demeter and Persephone due to their sacred association with the animal. Terracotta equivalents were also dedicated at the sanctuaries of these deities. These animals were also found buried with the dead. Stylistically, very little changed regarding the making and decoration of these boars.</p>
