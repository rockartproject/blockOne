<p>Case 4-Asia-Anatolia-Phrygia-Matar Kubileya-Terracotta-ca. 800 BCE </p><p>West-central Anatolian (now in Turkey), Phrygian terracotta figurine Matar Kubileya "Mountain Mother" ca. 800 BCE </p><p>This Matar Kubileya comes from the capital of Phrygia, Gordium (Greek: Γόρδιον, Górdion). She was later known as the Greek Κυβέλη, Kybele, and the Roman Cybele. Her oldest Anatolian cults were as a Great Mother associated with mountains, hawks and lions. In this unique terracotta figurine she wears a high mural headdress of the Phrygian capital Gordium, her place of origin. This headdress has two model bastions that were placed on either side of the city's entrance gate, which are still preserved at the archaeological site. This headdress indicates her role as protectress of the city. She is here portrayed in a flowing robe with a typically curled hair style.  Here she displays a Semitic facial countenance. Later, her Phrygian cult was adopted and adapted by Greek colonists of Anatolian Asia Minor and was diffused to mainland Greece and Magna Graecia in the 6th century BCE. 178 mm. high.</p>
