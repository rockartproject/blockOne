<p>Case 4-Eur-Magna Graecia-Demeter Seated-Terra Cotta-550 BCE</p><p>From an area of southern Italy which was populated by Greek immigrants, this seated Demeter wears a chiton covering her body indicated by a red slip over which is a a long himation gown, which runs close to her body.  Covered by a veil, she projects an aura of serene, benevolent majesty, feet  on a footstool, hands resting on her legs as though listening to a suppliant petitioner, who probably was beseeching her on matters of pregnancy and childbirth: votive figurines were offered to a deity devoted to a particular aspect of life. Original black pigment can still be discerned in the mascara of her eyes, and the definition of her hands, legs and hair. Round firing hole on base. 97 mm. high.</p>
