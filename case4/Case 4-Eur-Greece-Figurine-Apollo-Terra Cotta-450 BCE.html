He is presented frontally, with a chiton draped over his shoulders. His lips appear parted because Apollo functioned as a healer through song, called "paeαn" (παιάν), after the god Paean (Παιών-Παιήων), the physician of the Gods in the Iliad, who was derived from the Mycenean <em>Pa-ja-wo</em> (1900 BCE – ca. 1100 BCE) from Knossos, so his origins are very ancient. Apollo's practitioners or <em>iatromonteis</em> "seer-doctors" (ιατρομάντεις) used an ecstatic prophetic art (shamanism), which was the same as that used by the god at the Delphic Oracle. After ca. 400 BCE medicine and healing associated with Apollo were taken over by his son Asclepios and granddaughter Hygeia, who shared the epithet Paean, "the Healer." The original Hippocratic Oath began with the invocation "I swear by Apollo the Physician and by Asclepius and by Hygieia...". This figurine was probably used as a votive offering for healing and was probably sung to with the paeans the god had left to his "seer-doctors".</p><p><strong>LC Classification:</strong></p><p><strong>Date or Time Horizon:</strong> 450 BCE</p><p><strong>Geographical Area:</strong> </p><p><strong>Map: </strong></p><p><strong>GPS coordinates:</strong></p><p><strong>Cultural Affiliation:</strong> Archaic Greece</p><p><strong>Media:</strong> brown terra cotta</p><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong>  H 250 mm</p><p><strong>Weight:  </strong></p><p><strong>Condition: original</strong></p><p><strong>Provenance:</strong> </p><p><strong>Discussion: </strong>This is a hollow figurine with a firing hole on base and back</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p>
