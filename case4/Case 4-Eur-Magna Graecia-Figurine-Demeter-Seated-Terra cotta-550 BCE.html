Covered by a veil, she projects an aura of serene, benevolent majesty, feet  on a footstool, hands resting on her legs as though listening to a suppliant petitioner, who probably was beseeching her on matters of pregnancy and childbirth: votive figurines were offered to a deity devoted to a particular aspect of life. </p><p><strong>LC Classification:</strong></p><p><strong>Date or Time Horizon:</strong> </p><p><strong>Geographical Area:</strong> </p><p><strong>Map: </strong></p><p><strong>GPS coordinates:Cultural Affiliation:</strong> </p><p><strong>Media:</strong> terra cotta, Original black pigment can still be discerned in the mascara of her eyes, and the definition of her hands, legs and hair.</p><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> </p><p><strong>Weight:  </strong></p><p><strong>Condition:</strong></p><p><strong>Provenance:</strong> </p><p><strong>Discussion:</strong></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p>
