<p>Case 4-ME-Anatolia-Phrygia-Figurine-Matar Kubileya-Mountain Mother-Ceramic-800 BCE </p><p><strong>Case no.: 4</strong></p><p><strong>Accession Number:</strong></p><p><strong>Formal Label: ME-</strong>Anatolia-Phrygia-Figurine-Matar Kubileya-Mountain Mother-Ceramic-800 BCE</p><p><strong>Display Description: </strong></p><p>This Matar Kubileya comes from the capital of Phrygia, Gordium (Greek: Γόρδιον, Górdion). She was later known as the Greek Κυβέλη, Kybele, and the Roman Cybele. Her oldest Anatolian cults were as a Great Mother associated with mountains, hawks and lions. In this unique terracotta figurine she wears a high mural headdress of the Phrygian capital Gordium, her place of origin. This headdress has two model bastions that were placed on either side of the city's entrance gate, which are still preserved at the archaeological site. This headdress indicates her role as protectress of the city. She is here portrayed in a flowing robe with a typically curled hair style.  Here she displays a Semitic facial countenance. Later, her Phrygian cult was adopted and adapted by Greek colonists of Anatolian Asia Minor and was diffused to mainland Greece and Magna Graecia in the 6th century BCE.</p><p><strong>LC Classification:</strong></p><p><strong>Date or Time Horizon:</strong> </p><p><strong>Geographical Area:</strong> </p><p><strong>Map: </strong></p><p><strong>GPS coordinates:</strong></p><p><strong>Cultural Affiliation:</strong> </p><p><strong>Media:</strong> </p><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> H 178 mm</p><p><strong>Weight:  </strong></p><p><strong>Condition:</strong></p><p><strong>Provenance:</strong> </p><p><strong>Discussion:</strong></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p>
